Guided Assignment - Implementing Bubble Sort in C#
Introduction
In this assignment, you will implement and understand the Bubble Sort algorithm in C#, a fundamental sorting technique in computer programming. Bubble Sort is an intuitive algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This assignment will help you grasp the basics of sorting algorithms and their implementation in C#.

Pseudocode
procedure bubbleSort(arr: List of Comparable)
    // Get the length of the input array
    arrayLength = length(arr)
    
    // Initialize a flag to track whether any swaps occurred in a pass
    swapOccurred = true
    
    // Continue iterating until no swaps occur in a pass
    while swapOccurred is true
        // Reset the swap flag at the start of each pass
        swapOccurred = false
        
        // Iterate through the array elements from the first to the second-to-last element
        for currentIndex from 1 to arrayLength - 1
            // Compare the current element with the next element
            if arr[currentIndex - 1] > arr[currentIndex]
                // Swap the elements if they are out of order
                swap arr[currentIndex - 1] and arr[currentIndex]
                
                // Set the swap flag to true to indicate a swap occurred
                swapOccurred = true
            end if
        end for
    end while
end procedure

Step By Step
Step 1
Certainly, let's simplify the explanation and provide a code example for the pass loop in the Bubble Sort algorithm.

The pass loop is responsible for repeatedly going through the array and making sure that the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position at the end of the array. Here's a code example:

public static void BubbleSort(int[] arr)
{
    int arrayLength = arr.Length;

    for (int currentPass = 0; currentPass < arrayLength - 1; currentPass++)
    {
        /*
        - Inner Loop
        - Condition
        - Swapping Algorithm
        */
    }
}
In this code example:

The pass loop (currentPass) runs for a number of times equal to the length of the array minus one (arrayLength - 1). This ensures that we go through the entire array while moving the largest unsorted element to the end.
Step 2 - Inner Loop
Certainly, let's focus on explaining what the inner loop is doing in the Bubble Sort algorithm:

// for (int currentPass = 0; currentPass < arrayLength - 1; currentPass++)
// {
        for (int currentIndex = 0; currentIndex < arrayLength - 1 - currentPass; currentIndex++)
        {
            /*
                Condition
                Swapping Algorithnm
            */
        }
// }
The inner loop is responsible for comparing adjacent elements in the array and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what it does:

currentIndex Initialization: The inner loop starts with currentIndex set to 0, representing the first element of the unsorted portion of the array.
Step 3 - Condition
Certainly, let me provide you with a code example that focuses solely on the condition inside the loop:

for (int currentIndex = 0; currentIndex < arrayLength - 1 - currentPass; currentIndex++)
{
    if (arr[currentIndex] > arr[currentIndex + 1])
    {
        // Swapping Algorithm
    }
}
In this code snippet, the condition inside the loop is specifically checking whether the element at the currentIndex is greater than the next element (currentIndex + 1) in the array. This condition is used to determine if a swap is needed to bring the larger element towards the end of the unsorted portion of the array. If the condition is true, it means the elements are in the wrong order, and a swap is performed to correct their positions.

Step 4 - Swapping Algorithm
Certainly, here's the code with comments explaining each line:

// Store the value of the element at currentIndex in a temporary variable called temp
int temp = arr[currentIndex];

// Replace the value at currentIndex with the value of the next element (currentIndex + 1)
arr[currentIndex] = arr[currentIndex + 1];

// Assign the original value (stored in temp) back to the next element, completing the swap
arr[currentIndex + 1] = temp;
These comments describe what each line of code does:

We create a temporary variable temp to hold the value of the element at currentIndex.
We replace the value at currentIndex with the value of the next element (currentIndex + 1), effectively moving the next element to the current position.
We assign the original value (which we stored in temp) back to the next element, completing the swap between the two adjacent elements.
After these three lines of code execute, the values of the two adjacent elements in the arr array have been swapped, which is a fundamental operation in the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the array.

Step 5 - Putting all together
Of course, let's use more descriptive variable names and clarify the meaning of pass. Here's the modified BubbleSort method with improved variable names and explanations:

public static void BubbleSort(int[] arr)
{
    int arrayLength = arr.Length;
    bool hasSwapped;

    for (int currentPass = 0; currentPass < arrayLength - 1; currentPass++)
    {
        hasSwapped = false;

        for (int currentIndex = 0; currentIndex < arrayLength - 1 - currentPass; currentIndex++)
        {
            if (arr[currentIndex] > arr[currentIndex + 1])
            {
                // Swap arr[currentIndex] and arr[currentIndex + 1]
                int temp = arr[currentIndex];
                arr[currentIndex] = arr[currentIndex + 1];
                arr[currentIndex + 1] = temp;
                hasSwapped = true;
            }
        }

        // If no two elements were swapped in the inner loop, the array is already sorted
        if (!hasSwapped)
        {
            break;
        }
    }
}
In this version:

arrayLength represents the length of the array, making it clear.
hasSwapped is a boolean variable that indicates whether any swaps were made in a pass.
currentPass represents the current pass or iteration of the outer loop. Each pass brings the largest element to its final position, so it's like "passing" through the array.
currentIndex represents the current index within the array that is being compared and swapped.
The currentPass variable helps keep track of how many elements are sorted at the end of each pass, and it allows us to reduce the inner loop's range in subsequent passes to avoid unnecessary comparisons with already sorted elements.

Final Test
Code to add
using System;

class Program
{
    static Random random = new Random();

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int size = 10; // Change the size of the array as needed
        int minValue = 1; // Change the minimum value as needed
        int maxValue = 100; // Change the maximum value as needed

        int[] randomArray = GenerateRandomIntArray(size, minValue, maxValue);

		// Display your array in it's unsorted form

		// Call your bubble sort method

		// Display your method after its been sorted
    }

    static int[] GenerateRandomIntArray(int size, int minValue, int maxValue)
    {
        if (size <= 0 || minValue > maxValue)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException("Invalid arguments");
        }

        int[] arr = new int[size];
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
        {
            arr[i] = random.Next(minValue, maxValue + 1);
        }
        return arr;
    }

}
